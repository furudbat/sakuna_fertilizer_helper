# Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin Fertilizer Helper

Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin is an awesome game and the farming management is fun, but while mixing the fertilizer it can be very tedious to find out what item you need for remove toxicity, pesticide or other negative effects or even boost specific stats.  
So I made this Site to provide you help while mixing your "optimal" fertilizer and also providing you a Farming Guide.


## Features

* Farming Guide
  * Balanced-, Yield-, Heartiness-, Aesthetic- and Aroma-Harvest with Seasons
  * Planting space
* Fertilizer Mixer
  * shows additional Stats and Item-Effects
  * show _Recommended_ Items
  * show _Expiable_ Items
* Item-List
### How to use

1. Select a build you want to focus on (like Balanced, HP or Luck) in the Farming Guide.  
2. You can add Items into the Inventory from the Item-List.  
   Manage the Inventory list how ever you want, Items only you have in your games inventory, items you only want to use in fertilizer or just what you need.
3. Go to the Fertilizer Helper and add Items into the **Fertilizer Components**.
   In _Recommended_ (Items) you find Items for your current build like boosting yield (HP), Aroma (Magic) or Heartiness.  
   It's not perfect, but close enough :)
