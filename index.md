# Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin Fertilizer Helper

Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin is an awesome game and the farming management is fun, but while mixing the fertilizer it can be very tedious to find out what item you need for remove toxicity, pesticide or other negative effects or even boost specific stats.  
So I made this Site to provide you help while mixing your "optimal" fertilizer and also providing you a Farming Guide.

## How to use

1. Select a build you want to focus on (like Balanced, HP or Luck) in the [Farming Guide](#sectionFarmingGuide).  
2. You can add Items into the Inventory from the [Item-List](#sectionItemList).  
   Manage the Inventory list how ever you want, Items only you have in your games inventory, items you only want to use in fertilizer or just what you need.
3. Go to the [Fertilizer Helper](#sectionFertilizerHelper) and add Items into the **Fertilizer Components**.
   In _Recommended_ (Items) you find Items for your current build like boosting yield (HP), Aroma (Magic) or Heartiness.  
   It's not perfect, but close enough :)
