Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin is an awesome game and the farming managment is fun, but while mixing the fertilizer it can be very tedious to find out what item you need for remove toxicity, pestrcide or other negative effects.  
So I made this site as a Farming Guide and have the optimal fertilizer for your current build (Yield, Balanced, Aroma, ...).

Select a build from the [Farming Guide](#sectionFertilizerHelper).  
You can add Items into the Inventory from the [Items-List](#sectionItemList), then add Items to the fertilizer.
Manage the Inventory list how ever you want, Items only you have in your games inventory, items you only want to use in fertilizer, etc.
In "Recommended" (Items) you find Items for your current build like boosting yield (HP), Aroma (Magic) or Heartiness.
